=head1 NAME

ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToEscStatus - monitor printing in EscStatus form

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PerlIO::via::ToEscStatus;
 binmode (STDOUT, ':via(EscStatus)') or die;

 use ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToEscStatus;
 my $mon = ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToEscStatus->new
   ({ fields => [
        ProgressMonitor::Stringify::Fields::Spinner->new
   ]});

 $mon->prepare;
 $mon->begin;
 $mon->tick; $mon->tick; ...
 $mon->end;

=head1 CLASS HIERARCHY

C<ToEscStatus> is a subclass of C<AbstractMonitor>,

    ProgressMonitor
      ProgressMonitor::AbstractStatefulMonitor
        ProgressMonitor::Stringify::AbstractMonitor
          ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToEscStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ToEscStatus implements a ProgressMonitor which prints status lines in
EscStatus form, ready to be shown by an EscStatus layer on the output
stream.

Basically where C<ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToStream> would do something
like C<< print "\rStatus line" >>, the ToEscStatus instead does

    print make_status("Status line")

giving the output form EscStatus uses.  The contents of the status line are
built by the configured C<ProgressMonitor> field objects in the usual way.
See F<examples/progressmonitor.pl> in the EscStatus sources for a demo.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToEscStatus->new({key=>value,...}) >>

Create and return a new ToEscStatus progress monitor object.  Configuration
parameters are taken in usual Moose style as a single hashref argument.
This will normally at least include a C<fields> array of objects to do the
rendering.

See L<ProgressMonitor::Stringify::AbstractMonitor> for the base
configuration parameters.  ToEscStatus has the following additional
parameters

=over 4

=item C<stream> (default C<STDOUT>)

A file handle to write to.  The default is standard output, ie. C<\*STDOUT>
(the same as C<ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToStream>).

ToEscStatus doesn't check what layers are on the stream.  If for instance
you're printing to tty then it's your responsibility to push a
C<PerlIO::via::EscStatus>.  Similarly it's your responsibility to set
C<:utf8> mode or not, as desired.
