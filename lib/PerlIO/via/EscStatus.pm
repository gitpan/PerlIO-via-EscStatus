# Flush crib notes:
#
# IO::Handle::flush(), an xsub, calls PerlIO_flush() (per perlapio) and
# returns a status which can be returned by WRITE or CLOSE.
#
# A "local $|=1" to make print() do a flush (in the style of
# IO::Handle::printflush()) gets the flush status incorporated into the
# print() success return, but it does "flush/print/flush", and that first
# flush is wasteful.
#
# Believe autoflush $| is always off on the $fh subhandle, irrespective of
# whether or not it's set on the top-level.  Is that right?
#
# There's only two places to flush the lower handle: WRITE is the main one,
# and POPPED the other (apart from an explicit FLUSH).

=head1 NAME

PerlIO::via::EscStatus - dumb terminal status display layer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PerlIO::via::EscStatus qw(print_status);
 binmode (STDOUT, ':via(EscStatus)') or die;

 print_status ("Done 10% ...");
 print_status ("Done 20% ...");
 print "This is ordinary text output.\n";
 print_status ("Done 90% ...");
 print_status ("");   # erase status

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An EscStatus layer prints and reprints a status line using carriage returns
and backspaces for a dumb terminal.  This is meant as a progress or status
display in a command line program.

    Working ... record 20 of 80 (25%)
                                     ^--cursor left here

Status lines are communicated to EscStatus "in band" in the output stream
using an escape sequence.  Currently this is an ANSI "APC" application
control followed by the status line.  C<make_status> and C<print_status>
below produce this.

    "\e_EscStatus\e\\Status string\n"

The layer clears and redraws the status when ordinary output text is
printed, so it appears as normal.  The status is also erased when the layer
is popped, though unfortunately not when the stream is closed, see L</BUGS>
below.

=head2 Motivation

The idea of an output layer is that it lets you send ordinary output with
plain C<print>, C<printf>, etc, and the layer takes care of what status is
showing and will clear and redraw as necessary.

The alternative is a special message printing function to do the clearing.
If you're in full control of your ordinary output then that's fine (for
instance C<Term::ProgressBar> does it that way), but if you might have parts
of a library or program only setup with plain C<print> then a layer is a
good way to keep them from making a mess of the display.

The "in-band" method of passing status strings to the layer has the
advantage that higher layers can buffer or do extra transformations and
everything stays in the intended sequence.  It's even possible for a status
stream to come from a child process through a pipe or socket and stay in the
escapes form until being re-sent to a final EscStatus layer on C<STDOUT>.

The escape format chosen is meant to be easy to produce and tolerably
readable if for some reason crunching by EscStatus is missed.  The
C<EscStatus::ShowAll> layer lets you explicitly print all status lines for
development, or the C<EscStatus::ShowNone> layer lets you strip them for a
quiet mode or batch mode operation.  (See L<PerlIO::via::EscStatus::ShowAll>
and L<PerlIO::via::EscStatus::ShowNone>.)

=head1 CHARACTERS

Each status line is truncated to the width of the terminal as determined by
C<Term::Size::chars()> (see L<Term::Size>).  No attempt is made (as yet) to
monitor C<SIGWINCH> for changes to the width, though the size is checked for
each new line, so the next new status uses the new size.

EscStatus follows the "utf8" flag of the layer below it when first pushed,
allowing extended characters to be printed.  Often the layer below will be
an C<":encoding"> for the user's terminal.  The difference for EscStatus is
in the string width calculations for utf8 multibyte sequences.  Note that
changing the utf8 flag after pushing doesn't work properly (see L</BUGS>
below).

For string width calculations tabs (C<\t>) are 8 spaces.  Various East Asian
"double-width" characters take two columns.  BEL (C<\a>), ANSI escapes, and
various unicode modifier characters take no space.  If a status line is
truncated then all ANSI escapes are kept, so if say bold is turned on and
off then the off escape is preserved.

If a lower layer expands a character because it's unencodable on the final
output then that's likely to make a mess of the width calculation.  For
example the C<:encoding> layer C<PERLQQ> mode turns unencodables into an 8
character sequence C<"\x{1234}">, which is more than EscStatus will have
allowed for.  The suggestion is to expand or transform before EscStatus so
it sees what's really going to go out.  An encode and re-decode is one way
to do that, though a bit wasteful.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< print_status ($str,...) >>

=item C<< $str = make_status ($str,...) >>

Form a status line output string by concatenating the given C<$str> strings
and adding the necessary escape marker sequences.  C<print_status> prints it
to C<STDOUT>, C<make_status> returns it as a string.

Any newlines in the middle of the strings are changed to spaces, since only
a single line of status is possible.

=back

=head1 OTHER NOTES

The suggestion is to push C<PerlIO::via::EscStatus> onto C<STDOUT> and leave
C<STDERR> alone.  Leaving C<STDERR> alone has the advantage of not putting
anything in the way of an unexpected error print.  You can trap "normal"
errors and turn them into a print on C<STDOUT>, leaving C<STDERR> only for
the unexpected.  The alternative is to C<< >&= >> alias stderr onto stdout.
That makes sense since there's only one actual destination (the terminal),
once you trust EscStatus not to lose anything!

When updating the displayed status it's important not to hammer the terminal
with too much output.  It can easily become the speed of the terminal and
not the speed of the program which is the limiting factor.  The trick
generally is to print a new status only say once per second.  This means the
display isn't perfectly up-to-date, but the only time that's a problem is if
the program goes away number crunching for a long time with an old status
showing, in which case the wrong processing stage gets the blame for the
delay.

=head1 BUGS

When the stream is closed the status shown by EscStatus is not erased.  This
is because C<PerlIO::via> closes the sublayers first.  Perhaps that can
change in the future.  The suggestion when closing is to either print an
empty status to clear, or to pop the EscStatus (erasing works when popped).

    print_status ('');
    close STDOUT;  # or "exit 0" or whatever

If the utf8 flag on the stream is changed (by C<binmode>) EscStatus doesn't
notice and will keep using the state when it was first pushed.  Perhaps this
will change in the future, assuming there's sensible uses for turning it on
and off dynamically.

C<Term::Size> version 0.2 uses C<PerlIO_findFILE> and as of Perl 5.10.0 that
turns off the C<utf8> flag on the stream, preventing wide-char output.
EscStatus has a workaround for its use of C<Term::Size> but an application
might need to do the same.  The symptom is the usual "Wide character in
print" warning, on a stream you thought you'd already set for wide output.
