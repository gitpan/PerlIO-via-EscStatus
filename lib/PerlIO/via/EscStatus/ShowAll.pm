=head1 NAME

PerlIO::via::EscStatus::ShowAll - print all status lines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PerlIO::via::EscStatus::ShowAll;
 binmode (STDOUT, ':via(EscStatus::ShowAll)') or die;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a variant of the EscStatus layer which prints all status lines
coming through the stream, just with a newline each.  The effect is that
instead of each new status overwriting the previous they all display,
scrolling up the screen.  This is mainly intended for development or
diagnostic use.

With the current EscStatus output format this layer merely strips the
EscStatus "APC" intro control sequence and lets the rest go straight
through.  If your terminal doesn't mind miscellaneous APC sequences then it
might even be readable with no filtering at all.
