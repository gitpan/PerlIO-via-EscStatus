=head1 NAME

PerlIO::via::EscStatus::ShowNone - suppress all status lines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PerlIO::via::EscStatus::ShowNone;
 binmode (STDOUT, ':via(EscStatus::ShowNone)') or die;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<EscStatus::ShowNone> is a variant of the EscStatus layer which doesn't
show any status lines coming through the stream at all, only the ordinary
output.  This can be used for a batch mode or non-interactive mode in a
program.

Of course for batch mode it's also possible simply not to print statuses in
the first place.  You can decide whether it's easier to check a mode flag at
the print, or push a layer to strip what's printed.  A layer may be easier
for suppressing prints from a library or independent parts of a program.
