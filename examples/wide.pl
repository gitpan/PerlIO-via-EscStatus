# Usage: ./wide.pl
#
# This is an example of how "double-width" east asian characters are
# recognised by EscStatus as taking two columns each.  The status $str is
# 200 chars long, which will print as 400 columns, and it's truncated to fit
# in 80 columns (or however wide your terminal is).
#
# You'll need a unicode tty with asian fonts to see this properly,
# eg. "uxterm".
