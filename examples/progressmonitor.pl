# Usage: ./progressmonitor.pl
#
# This is a sample of ProgressMonitor::Stringify::ToEscStatus which directs
# ProgressMonitor states to a stream with an EscStatus layer.
#
# As noted in the ToEscStatus docs you have to push an EscStatus layer
# yourself but beyond that the only change part is $mon created as a
# ToEscStatus where you'd otherwise use a ToStream.
#
# Incidentally, if you've got some code using ToStream it'll still work fine
# with the EscStatus layer pushed.  The prints from ToStream are "ordinary
# output" for the purposes of the layer and go out unmolested.
